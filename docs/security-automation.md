# Security Automation

This public repository uses GitHub-native security automation that does not
require consumer credentials or a long-lived npm token.

## Workflows

- CodeQL runs JavaScript/TypeScript code scanning on pull requests, pushes to
  `main`, a weekly schedule, and manual dispatch. The workflow uses
  `github/codeql-action/init@v4` with `security-extended` and
  `security-and-quality` queries, then uploads results through code scanning.
  `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` excludes only
  `js/html-constructed-from-input`: this package intentionally exposes escaped
  SVG string renderers, and the renderer API docs plus `SECURITY.md` define the
  host sanitization boundary.
- Dependency Review runs on pull requests and blocks dependency changes that
  introduce high-or-worse known vulnerabilities.
- OpenSSF Scorecard runs on pushes to `main`, branch protection changes, a
  weekly schedule, and manual dispatch. It publishes Scorecard results and
  uploads SARIF into GitHub code scanning.

## Repository Settings

The GitHub repository should keep these security settings enabled:

- Dependabot alerts.
- Dependabot security updates.
- Automated security fixes.
- Private vulnerability reporting.
- Secret scanning.
- Secret scanning push protection.

GitHub may leave optional secret-scanning features such as non-provider pattern
scanning or validity checks disabled depending on account and repository
availability. Those are useful when available, but they are not required for
the package release lane.

## Local Proof

`npm run test:security-automation` checks the workflow files, security docs,
package scripts, and repository-readiness wiring. It cannot prove GitHub
account-level toggles locally; verify those with:

```bash
gh api repos/Ponchia/bronto-annotations --jq '{security_and_analysis}'
gh api repos/Ponchia/bronto-annotations/private-vulnerability-reporting --jq '{enabled}'
```

`npm run check` includes the local security automation check.
